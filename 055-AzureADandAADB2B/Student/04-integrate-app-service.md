# Challenge \#5 - Register an application in Azure AD

[< Previous Challenge](./03-invite-guest.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./05-integrate-app.md)

## Introduction

App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization support, so you can sign in users with no code in your web app. Using the optional App Service authentication/authorization module simplifies authentication and authorization for your app. When you are ready for custom authentication and authorization, you build on this architecture.

## Success Criteria

1. Integrate Azure AD authentication into an Azure App Service (EasyAuth).

Please note that you might have to use Microsoft tenant as your newly created tenant will not have any subscription associated with.
